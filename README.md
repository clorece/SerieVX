SerieVX is a reimagination of Allium that focuses on gameplay while having Voxel Path Tracing features, such as worldspace global illumination and colored lights. Serie has taken a huge inspiration from Soft Voxels and VXFluff with the softly lit appearance.

This shader is still a work in progress, so please expect a lot of bugs and issues.
